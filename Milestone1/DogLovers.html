    <h3 class="theme1">TYPES OF BREEDS AVAILABLE FOR NOW:</h3>
    <ol type='a'>
        <li class="theme2">German Shepherd</li>
        <p>German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, 
            and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females. German Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2.
             The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.
             They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown.
             The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement.
              A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking.
            The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.</p>

        <li class="theme2">Pomeranian</li>
        <p>
            Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm) high at the withers.
             They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.
             The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.

        <li class="theme2">Retrievers</li>
        <p>
            A retriever is a type of <strong>gun dog</strong> that retrieves game for a hunter. Generally gun dogs are divided into three major classifications: retrievers, flushing spaniels, and pointing breeds.
             Retrievers were bred primarily to retrieve birds or other prey and return them to the hunter without damage,
              retrievers are distinguished in that nonslip retrieval is their primary function.

        <li class="theme2">Dobermann</li>
        <p>
            Dobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and properly trained,
            they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.

        <li class="theme2">Dalmatian</li>
        <p>
            The Dalmatian is a breed of medium-sized dog, noted for its unique white coat marked with black or brown-colored spots. Originating as a hunting dog,
             it was also used as a carriage dog in its early days. The origins of this breed can be traced back to present-day Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia.
            It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers and a spotted Great Dane. Today, it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.

        <li class="theme2">Himalayan Husky</li>
        <p>
            A husky is a sled dog used in the polar regions. One can differentiate huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style. Modern racing huskies (also known as <strong>Alaskan huskies</strong>)
             represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs (the Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, pulled heavier loads at a slower speed).
             Humans use huskies in <strong>sled-dog racing</strong>. Various companies have marketed tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions.
             Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for <strong>retired racing</strong> and <strong>adventure-trekking dogs</strong>.
